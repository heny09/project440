==========

This is a Jquiry project that includes css and HTML coding. It is a webpage (which is cis440.htm) that used jquiry (Jquiry.js)
to minipulate pictures in the image folder. The jquiry is also used to style the HTML code in the cis440.htm. It is also used to link the browzer to a diffrent page. This demonstrates the ability to synchronize Jquiry, HTML, jpg folders and all in one. 
The click on my tag (a <p> tag) is used to re direct the page to a website which demenostrate the powerful featuring of jquiry in html. The browzer redirects to my website which I made using google website, which is also free. 
So this is all free staff that I used to do make my webpage do thing I want it to. 
  The other folder is an extra folder of codes of jquery that I made to make the picturs apper in the center and slide. For this assinment I will be focused on the CID440.htm which will pull the information for the js and image folder whcih should directs to the free googlwebsite.
